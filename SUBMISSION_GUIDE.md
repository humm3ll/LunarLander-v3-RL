## 📧 Sample Email to Professor

```
Subject: CIS2719 Coursework 2 Submission - LunarLander-v3 RL Comparison

Dear Professor [Name],

Please find my Coursework 2 submission for CIS2719 - Foundations of Robotics & AI.

Google Colab Notebook: [INSERT YOUR COLAB LINK HERE]

The notebook contains:
- Complete implementation of DQN, DDQN, and PER algorithms
- Results from 10 experimental runs (600-10,000 episodes)
- Learning curves and agent behavior visualizations
- Detailed analysis and documentation

All code is executable in Colab, though results are pre-loaded from my GitHub
repository for your convenience. The notebook is ready to view and includes
detailed comments throughout.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Ethan Hulme

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Before Submitting:

- [ ] Make sure your GitHub repository is **public**
- [ ] Verify the repository URL in cell 2 is correct
- [ ] Test the notebook by running a few cells
- [ ] Confirm all images and GIFs display properly
- [ ] Set appropriate sharing permissions in Colab

### About Training:

- **You don't need to re-train** - All results are already in your GitHub repo
- The training code in Section 5 is **commented out** and optional
- Your professor can see the code without having to run hours of training

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"GitHub clone failed"**
- Check the URL in cell 2 matches your repo exactly
- Make sure the repo is public (not private)

**"Images not displaying"**
- Verify the "Test Results" folder structure in your GitHub repo
- Make sure the file paths in the notebook match your repo structure

**"Professor can't access"**
- Check sharing settings in Colab
- Try setting to "Anyone with the link can view"
- Confirm you sent the correct link
